//! qmdb-backed pages module — a notion-like block tree, one block per key.
//!
//! a page is a TREE of [`Block`]s: a `Page` block starts the document (its text
//! is the title), every block carries an ordered `children` list, and
//! every block id is GLOBALLY UNIQUE within the module. unlike the document
//! module's whole-doc-per-key layout, the store key here is `sha256(block_id)`
//! and the value is ONE serialized block — so the merkle root commits to every
//! block individually, and a single block is readable (and one day provable)
//! by id alone with no page context. that is the addressability contract: any
//! module can resolve a bare block id via `Ctx::query(pages, GetBlock {
//! block_id })`.
//!
//! pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`]: the HOST constructs
//! the concrete store (qmdb today — `statesync::qmdb::QmdbStore`) and hands it
//! to [`Pages::new`], so this crate never names a storage crate. the module's
//! authenticated [`StateRoot`] IS the store's merkle root, so it flows
//! directly into the global root-hash via `host::global_root`.
//!
//! ## keys are hashed to a fixed width
//!
//! the logical key is the `block_id` string at the interface seam, but the
//! store key is `sha256(block_id)` — a fixed 32-byte digest, mirroring the
//! kv/document modules. this is load-bearing: the store's state-sync
//! resolvers are bounded on fixed-width keys.
//!
//! ## enumeration via a reserved index entry
//!
//! one extra store entry is reserved: the sentinel logical key
//! [`PAGE_INDEX_KEY`] whose value is the serialized SORTED map from every page
//! block id to its containing page. its leading NUL makes it uncollidable with
//! a client-minted block id, and every op that names it is rejected before any
//! storage touch. top-level pages enter through [`PageMsg::CreatePage`]; nested
//! pages are ordinary `Page` blocks, so insert/move/remove update this index in
//! the same staged transaction as the block tree.
//!
//! ## host-lent staging (the kv/document pattern, plus deletes)
//!
//! writes made during a block are STAGED in an in-memory `pending` overlay and
//! flushed to the store in ONE batch by `commit_block`; `abort_block` drops
//! the overlay. the pages twist: `RemoveBlock` deletes a whole subtree, so the
//! overlay value is an `Option<Vec<u8>>` — `Some` stages a write, `None`
//! stages a DELETE (`commit_batch`'s `None`), and reads through the overlay
//! see a staged delete as absence.
//!
//! ## state-sync
//!
//! sync belongs to the injected store, not this module: a joiner (dynamic-
//! valset catch-up, a fresh full node, crash recovery) rebuilds the CONCRETE
//! store from a peer (`QmdbStore::sync_from`) and wraps a fresh `Pages` around
//! it. this module only forwards the trait's serve surface —
//! [`Module::serve_sync`] and [`Module::resolver_sync_target`] delegate
//! straight to the store.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
